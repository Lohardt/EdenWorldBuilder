---Version 1.7---
-Five creatures to play with and put in your creations.
--In addition to being adorable they are game objects, they interact with all the special blocks(like ice slides/water/etc.) and tools.
-Lots of new sound effects and music.

-Various minor bug fixes and tweaks, partially listed below
--TNT now launches you away from explosions
--Fixed freeze downloading maps for partially connected or weak internet connections
--Fixed some rendering glitches and rare crashes.
--Glass texture changed
--Changed how water current works slightly


---Version 1.6---
-Retina support and graphics update
-Flowing liquids
--Easy to build with and remove so you don't permanently flood your world
-Better explosions and improved fire
-Much faster loading 

-Various interface improvements
--Build Icon shows current block, you can now paint the current block and then build with that block
--Ice slides will automatically adjust camera when you turn
--Autojumps when moving forward,  autojumps when placing a block under you

-New option: Toggle autojump when moving forward
-New option: Graphics quality toggle: Fast/Best  
Currently just disables in-game retina on fast, has no effect on non-retina devices but will in future updates.

-Removed option: Invert Camera.  It doesn't make sense with touch/swipe controls
-Removed option: Caves.  Due to rendering engine limitations they have a high performance cost. 
To play a world with caves you can download an old one from the shared worlds.
